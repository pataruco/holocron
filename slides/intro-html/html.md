# The 3 Layers of the Web

- **HTML** is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content.
- **CSS** is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content.
- **JavaScript** is a scripting language that enables you to manipulate dynamically content and style.
