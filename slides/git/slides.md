# Version Control

### Pedro Martin

---

## Objective

By the end of the session you'll be able to:

* Keep your project backed up and well organised

---

## Version control

Have you ever lost or overwritten some work that took you ages?

---

## Version control

**Version control** is a system that enables you to take regular _snapshots_ of your work in progress called _commits_. This enables:

* Recording the history of a project
* Constant backups of your work
* A more organised development workflow
* A safer way to collaborate with others
* Tools for publishing your work online

---

## Version control

* Keeping your code organised helps you be more efficient.
* Keeping your work backed up helps you stay sane.
* Going back over the history of a project helps you learn.

---

## Commits

Think of each commit as if you copied your whole project folder and saved it somewhere safe.

This folder is labeled with a unique ID and recorded in a chronological timeline.

If you want to view what a file looked like at any point in history you can open up the folder with a certain commit ID and take a look at the files inside.

---

## Commits

Instead of making a complete copy of your project for every snapshot, Version control systems can just save the differences between files.

This keeps the history small in file size and quick to work with.

---

## Version control

The most popular version control system in use today is called **git**.

Projects are stored in something called a **repository** which is just like a collection of files and folders.

You have a **local** repo on your laptop and a **remote** repo online and the two are connected.

---

## Version control

**git** is a command line tool but there are lots of visual applications that make the process easier to use.

---

## Version control process

A typical git workflow goes like this:

* Create a project folder
* Initialize it as a git project
* Write some code
* Check the status of what files/folders have changed
* Mark one or more files to be added into the next snapshot

---

## Version control process

* Take a snapshot and write a message describing what you did and why
* Write some more code
* Create the next snapshot
* Rinse and repeat often
* Push your changes to an online repository

---

## Version control process

Commit often even as you experiment.

Push regularly once everything is in good shape.

---

## Commit messages

Think of each commit message like an email. You have a brief subject and (an optional) longer description to describe what you did and why

---

## Git for final projects

---

## GitHub desktop workflow

* Create a new project via the `+` button
* Select the `create` tab
* Add a name for your project folder
* Choose where to save it
* Write some code
* Switch back to Github and check the `changes` tab

---

## GitHub desktop workflow

* Select the files to be committed
* Write a commit message
* Click `commit to master`
* Write some more code, commit again
* Check the history of changes
* Publish your repo to Github
* Code, commit and sync work regularly
